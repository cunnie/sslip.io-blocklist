# List of "Forbidden" names

# This is a list of forbidden names that are often used in phishing attacks. We
# won't properly resolve these names for public IP addresses (e.g. we won't
# resolve "aiffeisen.94.228.116.140.sslip.io" to 94.228.116.140; instead, we'll
# resolve it to one of our servers, ns-aws.sslip.io)

# Forbidden names are okay for private networks, e.g.
# "raiffeisen.192.168.0.1.sslip.io", because they aren't publicly accessible &
# thus can't be used for phishing attempts. We properly resolve such hostnames.

# File format: blank lines are ignored, "#" are comments and are ignored. One
# name per line.
