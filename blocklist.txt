# List of "Forbidden" (blocked) names & CIDRs

# This is a list of forbidden names and CIDRs that are often used in phishing
# attacks. We won't resolve these hostnames to their embedded IP address (e.g.
# we won't resolve "raiffeisen.94.228.116.140.sslip.io" to 94.228.116.140);
# instead, we'll resolve it to one of our server's, ns-aws.sslip.io's, IP
# addresses, 52.0.56.137 or 2600:1f18:aaf:6900::a.  Similarly, we won't resolve
# nf-43-134-66-67.sslip.io to 43.134.66.67 because it falls within one of our
# blocked CIDRs (43.134.66.67/24).

# Forbidden names are resolved as expected for private networks (e.g.
# "raiffeisen.192.168.0.1.sslip.io" resolves to 192.168.0.1) because they
# aren't publicly accessible & thus can't be used for phishing attempts.

# File format: blank lines are ignored, "#" are comments and are ignored. One
# name or CIDR per line.
